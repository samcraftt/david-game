The David Game is best with four or more people. Each player starts by submitting a sentence that can be drawn, ideally something creative and obscure.
Upon finishing their sentence, each player "passes" their sentence for the next player to draw.
After finishing the drawing, that second player once again "passes" their drawing to the next player, who will write a sentence summarizing the illustration.
This process continues, alternating from sentence to drawing, until each player's starting sentence has been "passed" seven times.<br><br>
Upon completion, the results of the game are displayed to the group, showcasing the nuances and obsurities that evolved from each original sentence.<br><br>
"DavidGameApp.swift" accounts for essentially all of the main app flow and functionality.
